## Problem Statement

In this project, **we will study, analyze, cluster, and compare the neighborhoods of two important cities in the world**: New York City which is located in United States of America and Toronto which is located in Canada. We will investigate on what kinds of businesses are common in both cities, what kinds of businesses are more common in one of the two cities than the other city, and what kinds of businesses are *not* common in both cities,.

Doing this project will enable us to get a better understanding of similarities and differences between the two cities. The results of this project will make it known to business people what types of businesses are more likely to **thrive** in both cities, what are the neighborhoods that are **suitable** for each type of business, and what types of businesses are not very desirable in each city. This allows business people to take better and more effective decisions regarding where to open their businesses.

**New York City** (NYC) is one of the most most populous city in the United States of America. Also, NYC is the most linguistically diverse city in the world: as many as 800 languages are spoken in it. Moreover, NYC plays an essential role in the economics of USA: if New York City were a sovereign state, it would have the 12th highest GDP in the world. New York City consists of five boroughs: Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, The Bronx, and Staten Island.

The second city of interest in this project is **Toronto**. As with NYC in USA, Toronto is the most populous city in Canada. It's recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world. Toronto also is a very diverse city: over 160 languages are spoken in it. On the economic side, Toronto is an international centre for business and finance and it is considered the financial capital of Canada.

## Data Description

To be able to do this project, we need appropriate data. In particular, we need two types of data:

- Datasets that lists the neighborhood of NYC and Toronto with their latitude and longitude coordinates. We have some of this data provided by the coordinators of "IBM Data Science Professional Certificate" and we also need to scrape some data from the internet.
- Venues data: data that describes the top 100 venues (restaurants, cafes, parks, museums, etc.) in each neighborhood of the two cities. The data should list the venues of each neighborhood with their categories: for example, "venue: Los Mariscos; category: Seafood". We will retrieve this data from Foursquare which is one of the world largest sources of location and venue data. We will use Foursquare API to get and download the data.
